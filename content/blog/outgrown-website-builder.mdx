You started with Wix or Squarespace because it was easy. Drag, drop, done. No code required.

But now you're hitting walls:
- Your site loads slow
- You can't rank in Google
- The design looks like every other template
- You're paying $30/mo for features you don't use
- Every "simple" change takes an hour of fighting the editor

Sound familiar?

Here are 7 signs it's time to ditch the builder and go custom.

---

## 1. Your Site Loads Slower Than Your Competitors

**The Problem:**
Website builders load *everything* - features you use, features you don't, tracking scripts, template bloat. Your site might be 5MB when it should be 500KB.

**Why it matters:**
- Google ranks fast sites higher
- 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load
- Every second of delay = 7% fewer conversions

**The test:**
Run your site through [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). If you're scoring below 50, you're losing customers.

**What custom fixes:**
Custom Next.js sites load in under 1 second. We optimize images, eliminate unnecessary scripts, and only load what's needed. Typical Lighthouse score: 90+.

## 2. You're Nowhere in Google Search Results

**The Problem:**
Squarespace and Wix aren't *bad* for SEO, but they limit what you can control:
- Can't customize meta tags per section
- Structured data is basic (or broken)
- URL structures are messy (`yoursite.com/services-1-2-3`)
- Page speed kills your rankings (see #1)

**The reality:**
Your competitors with custom sites are outranking you because they have full control over technical SEO.

**What custom fixes:**
- Clean URLs you control
- Proper meta tags, Open Graph, structured data
- Fast page speed (Google's #1 ranking factor)
- Sitemap optimization
- Full control over heading hierarchy

---

## 3. You're Paying $30+/Month for Features You Don't Use

**The breakdown:**
- Wix Business: $32/mo
- Squarespace Business: $33/mo
- Shopify Basic (if you added e-commerce you don't need): $39/mo

**What you're actually using:**
- Hosting
- SSL certificate
- A contact form

**What you're paying for but not using:**
- E-commerce features
- Marketing integrations you don't touch
- "Premium" templates
- Priority support you've never contacted

**What custom costs:**
$750 one-time build + $18/mo hosting. That's it. No upsells, no premium tiers.

---

## 4. Every Design Change Breaks Something Else

**The builder trap:**
Move a button → entire section shifts.
Change a font → breaks mobile layout.
Add an image → pushes everything down.

**Why this happens:**
Builders use complex grid systems and absolute positioning. Change one thing, break three others. You spend 2 hours "fixing" what should take 5 minutes.

**What custom fixes:**
Hand-coded layouts behave predictably. Move a button, it moves. No surprises, no cascading breaks.

---

## 5. Your Site Looks Like a Template (Because It Is)

**The honest truth:**
Squarespace templates look good. But customers recognize them. "Oh, that's the Brine template" or "I've seen that layout on 50 other sites."

**Why it hurts:**
- No differentiation from competitors
- Looks DIY (even if you paid for "premium")
- Hard to match your actual brand

**What custom gives you:**
A site that looks like *your* brand. Not Squarespace's brand. Not a template 500 other businesses are using.

---

## 6. You Can't Implement Features Your Business Needs

**Common blockers:**
- "Can I add a service area map?" → Requires expensive plugin
- "Can we integrate with my booking system?" → Not supported
- "Can I customize the checkout flow?" → Only in $70/mo plan
- "Can I change the mobile menu behavior?" → Nope, locked to template

**The pattern:**
Every feature you *actually* need is either:
1. Behind a paywall
2. Not possible
3. Requires a janky third-party integration

**What custom allows:**
If it can be coded, we can build it. Need a custom integration? Done. Want specific mobile behavior? No problem.

---

## 7. You're Embarrassed to Send People to Your Website

**The feeling:**
You're talking to a potential client. They ask for your website. You hesitate.

"It's... a work in progress."
"I'm redesigning it soon."
"Sorry, it's not great on mobile."

**Why this happens:**
You know it looks DIY. You know it's slow. You know it doesn't represent how professional you actually are.

**The cost:**
Every person who visits your site and bounces is a lost customer. Your website is supposed to *help* your business, not hurt it.

## The Migration Path: Builder → Custom

**What you're worried about:**

"Will I lose my Google rankings?"
→ No. We do proper 301 redirects. Your SEO transfers.

"What about my domain?"
→ Keep it. We connect your existing domain to the new site.

"Can I keep the same content?"
→ Yes. We port it over. Usually improves with light editing.

"Will it be more complicated to update?"
→ Content updates go through us (2 free per month), but you're not fighting a janky editor anymore.

**The upgrade process:**

1. **Week 1:** We build your new custom site on a staging URL
2. **Week 2:** You review, we revise
3. **Week 3:** We go live (domain transfer, redirects, all handled)
4. **Week 4:** Your old builder subscription gets cancelled

## Real Migration: Yoga Studio Owner

**Before (Squarespace):**
- Paying $33/mo
- PageSpeed score: 31
- Not ranking for "yoga Calgary"
- Looked like every other wellness template
- Couldn't customize class schedule layout

**After (Custom Next.js):**
- Paying $18/mo
- PageSpeed score: 94
- Page 1 for "yoga Canmore" in 3 weeks
- Unique design matching her brand
- Custom class schedule exactly how she wanted

**Her quote:**
"I wish I'd done this a year ago. My Squarespace site was costing me clients."

## When Builders *Are* the Right Choice

Let's be fair. Builders work great if:

- You're testing a business idea (not committed yet)
- You need a site *today* (like, in the next 2 hours)
- You have zero budget ($750 is too much)
- You're okay with "good enough"
- You don't care about SEO or page speed
- You're planning to rebuild in 6 months anyway

But if you're serious about your business, getting leads, and not embarrassed by your site... it's time to upgrade.

## The Custom Alternative

**What you get:**
- Hand-coded Next.js site (no templates)
- Launched in one week
- Lighthouse score 90+
- Full SEO setup
- Mobile-optimized
- $750 one-time + $18/mo hosting

**What you're leaving behind:**
- Slow load times
- Template designs
- SEO limitations
- Monthly fees for features you don't use
- The builder editor (and all its quirks)

**Common Migration Questions:**

**Q: Will my SEO tank during the migration?**
A: No. We set up 301 redirects from your old URLs to new ones. Google follows these and transfers your rankings.

**Q: Can I cancel my builder subscription right away?**
A: Wait until after we launch. We need the old site live while we build the new one, then we do a clean cutover.

**Q: What if I have a blog with 50 posts?**
A: We can migrate simple blogs. Complex blogs (with categories, tags, comments) are a separate project. Ask us.

**Q: Do I need to rewrite all my content?**
A: No. We port it over as-is. Light editing usually helps, but not required.
