## Speed Is a Feature

Most businesses spend 3–6 months on their first website. Endless revisions, committee decisions, feature creep. By the time they launch, the market has moved on.

**The 6-day timeline forces clarity:**

- You can't overthink copy when you have 24 hours to deliver it
- You prioritize what actually converts vs. what sounds clever
- You ship a real business tool, not a digital brochure

## What Actually Matters on Day One

Your first website needs three things:

1. **Clear value proposition** — what you do, who it's for, why now
2. **Social proof** — testimonials, portfolio, credentials that build trust
3. **Easy contact path** — phone, email, form—whatever gets responses

Everything else is a distraction.

### The Cost of Delay

Every week you spend "perfecting" your site is a week you're not:

- Ranking in search results (SEO takes months to kick in)
- Testing what messaging actually converts
- Building backlinks and domain authority
- Collecting real user feedback

**Launched beats perfect. Every time.**

## How the 6-Day Process Works

**Day 1:** You deliver content, branding, and requirements. We align on goals.

**Days 2-3:** We design and build your custom site with your content.

**Day 4:** First review. You provide feedback, we refine.

**Day 5:** Final touches, testing, performance optimization.

**Day 6:** Launch. Your site is live, SSL secured, analytics tracking.

No endless revisions. No scope creep. Just a professional site that works.

## The Business Case

Let's say you're a local contractor charging $5,000 per job. If a fast website lands you one extra client per month, that's $60,000/year.

**The math:**

- Website build: $750 one-time
- Care & Hosting: $18/mo ($216/year)
- Total year-one cost: $966
- Revenue from one extra job/month: $60,000

**ROI: 6,110%**

Even if you only close one job from your website in the entire first year, you're still 5x ahead.

## Common Objections (And Why They're Wrong)

### "But I need time to think about my messaging"

You've been running your business for months or years. You know what you do and who you help. A tight deadline forces you to articulate it clearly instead of overcomplicating it.

### "What if I want to change things later?"

You will. Every business evolves. That's why the Care & Hosting plan includes two content updates per month. Launch now, refine later.

### "I need more features"

No, you don't. You need customers. Features come later, after you validate what actually matters to your market.

## The Bottom Line

Perfect is the enemy of launched.

A fast website gives you:

- **Speed to market** — start ranking, testing, converting
- **Lower risk** — smaller upfront investment, faster feedback loop
- **Competitive advantage** — you're live while competitors are still debating fonts

**Ship in 6 days. Refine with revenue.**
