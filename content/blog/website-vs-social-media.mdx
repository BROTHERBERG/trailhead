## The Conventional Wisdom Is Backwards

Ask any marketing guru where to start and they'll say: "Build your Instagram following first, then worry about a website."

Sounds smart. Social media is free, websites cost money. Get traction first, invest later.

**Here's the problem:** You're building your business on rented land. And the landlord can change the rules whenever they want.

## What Happened to Businesses That Went Social-First

### The Algorithm Apocalypse

In 2018, Facebook changed its algorithm. Organic reach for business pages dropped from 16% to 2% overnight.

**Translation:** A business with 10,000 followers went from reaching 1,600 people per post to 200. Without paying for ads.

Businesses that relied solely on Facebook? Dead in the water.

### The Instagram Shadowban

Post too often? Shadowbanned. Use the wrong hashtags? Shadowbanned. Someone reports your post? Shadowbanned.

**Reality check:** You can do everything right and still wake up invisible to your audience.

### The Platform Risk

- Vine: Shut down
- Google+: Shut down
- Mixer: Shut down
- Tumblr: Banned adult content, lost 99% of traffic

**The pattern:** Platforms come and go. The businesses that survived had their own websites.

## Why a Website Comes First

### You Own the Platform

Your website can't be shadowbanned. Instagram can't change your reach. Facebook can't delete your audience.

**Control matters:** You decide what shows up, when it shows up, and who sees it.

### You Capture the Lead

Someone visits your Instagram? Great. They leave? They're gone forever unless you convert them.

**The website difference:** Email capture, lead magnets, retargeting pixels. You turn anonymous visitors into contactable leads.

### You Look Legitimate

Pop quiz: You need a lawyer. You find two options:
- Option A: Instagram page with 5,000 followers
- Option B: Professional website with client testimonials

**Who do you call?** Exactly.

### SEO Is Still Free Traffic

Ranking on Google = free customers forever. Instagram posts? They die in 24 hours.

**Example:** A plumber ranks #1 for "emergency plumber [city]." That's worth $50k+/year in free leads. Try getting that from Instagram.

## The Right Way to Do Both

You don't have to choose. Here's the smart play:

### Week 1: Launch Your Website

6 days to build, 1 day to populate with content. Total investment: $750.

**What you get:**
- Professional home base
- Lead capture system
- Google search visibility
- 24/7 salesperson

### Week 2: Point Everything at Your Website

Now use social media for what it's good for: driving traffic.

- Instagram bio link → Website
- Facebook posts → Website blog
- YouTube description → Website contact page

**The shift:** Social becomes the funnel, website becomes the conversion engine.

## Real Business Example

**Meet Sarah, Wedding Photographer**

**Year 1 (Instagram-First):**
- Built to 12,000 followers
- Booked 30 weddings via DM
- Income: $90,000
- Hours spent DMing: ~400

**Year 2 (Website-First):**
- Same 12,000 followers
- Instagram bio → Website with pricing/packages
- Contact form captures leads automatically
- Booked 45 weddings
- Income: $135,000
- Hours spent DMing: ~50

**The difference:** A website automated her sales process and gave her time back.

## The "But Social Media Is Free" Myth

Social media isn't free. You're paying with time.

**Instagram cost breakdown:**
- 1 hour/day creating content = 365 hours/year
- Your hourly rate: $75
- **Real cost: $27,375/year**

**Website cost:**
- $750 upfront
- $18/month maintenance ($216/year)
- **Real cost: $966/year**

Which is actually "free"?

## When Social Media Actually Works First

There are exceptions. You should go social-first if:

### You're Selling Visual Products

Fashion, art, design, food—anything Instagram-native where the product sells itself visually.

**But even then:** You need a website to handle transactions. Nobody's Venmo-ing you $500 for custom art.

### You're Building in Public

SaaS founders, content creators, thought leaders—people where the journey IS the product.

**The catch:** Your end goal is still to convert followers into email subscribers (which requires a website).

### You're Testing Demand

Validating a product idea with a small audience before investing in infrastructure.

**Timeline:** 30-60 days max. Then you need a real platform.

## The Businesses That Win Do Both—In the Right Order

1. **Launch website** (Week 1)
2. **Start creating content** (Week 2+)
3. **Drive social traffic to website** (Ongoing)
4. **Capture emails** (Ongoing)
5. **Own your audience** (Forever)

**The endgame:** Social media drives discovery. Your website drives conversion. Your email list drives repeat business.

## The 6-Day Decision

You could spend 6 months "building your Instagram" and hope the algorithm doesn't change.

Or you could spend 6 days building a website and own your platform forever.

**One of these protects your business. The other is a gamble.**
