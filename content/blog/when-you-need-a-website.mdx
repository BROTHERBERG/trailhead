## The Question Every New Business Asks

You're starting a business. Instagram? Check. Google My Business? Done. Business cards? Ordered. Website? ...maybe later?

Here's the truth: **not every business needs a website on day one.** But when you do need one, waiting too long costs you real money.

## You Don't Need a Website Yet If...

### You're Still Validating Your Idea

Testing a product concept with a dozen customers? Save your money. A landing page or social media works fine while you're still figuring out product-market fit.

**What to do instead:** Instagram bio link, Google Form for inquiries, or a simple Linktree. Total cost: $0.

### Your Entire Market Lives on One Platform

Running a nail salon where 100% of bookings come from Instagram DMs? A website won't change that—at least not yet.

**When this changes:** When you want to expand beyond your immediate neighborhood, or when Instagram's algorithm stops being reliable.

### You're Pre-Revenue and Bootstrapping

If you haven't made your first sale, a website is a luxury. Focus on finding customers first, building second.

**The exception:** If your business model requires online transactions (e-commerce, SaaS, etc.), you need it from day one.

## You Need a Website Now If...

### Customers Are Asking "What's Your Website?"

This is the clearest signal. If you're saying "we're working on it" more than once a week, you're losing credibility—and probably sales.

**Why it matters:** People research before they buy. No website = immediate trust loss.

### You're Paying for Ads

Running Facebook or Google ads without a website is burning money. You're sending traffic to platforms you don't control, with no way to capture leads or retarget.

**The math:** If you're spending $500/month on ads, a $750 website pays for itself in week one.

### You Want to Look Legitimate

Harsh truth: businesses without websites look amateur. Even if you do great work, prospects judge you in 3 seconds.

**Example:** Two landscaping companies. Same prices, same reviews. One has a website, one doesn't. Who do you call?

### You're Losing Local Business to Competitors

Google "plumber near me." The top results all have websites. If you're not there, you're invisible.

**Reality check:** 76% of people who search for something nearby visit a business within 24 hours. Without a website, you're not even in the race.

### You Need to Capture Leads

Taking phone calls all day kills productivity. A website with a contact form + calendar lets customers book or inquire on their schedule, not yours.

**The shift:** From reactive (answering calls) to proactive (following up with qualified leads).

## The Real Cost of Waiting

Let's do the math on a real scenario:

- Your service costs $2,000 per customer
- You get 5 inquiries per week
- 20% convert to customers (1 sale/week)
- A website could double your inquiry rate to 10/week

**Without a website:** 1 sale/week = $104k/year
**With a website:** 2 sales/week = $208k/year
**Cost of waiting 6 months:** $52,000 in lost revenue

Suddenly a $750 website seems cheap.

## The "I'll Build It Myself" Trap

DIY sounds smart until you're 3 months in, still tweaking fonts, and haven't launched.

**The hidden cost:** Your time. If your hourly rate is $100, a 40-hour DIY project costs $4,000—plus the opportunity cost of projects you didn't take because you were "building the website."

**The alternative:** Pay $750, launch in 6 days, get back to making money.

## When You Know, You Know

You don't need a checklist. You know you need a website when:

- You're embarrassed to say you don't have one
- You're losing business to competitors who do
- You're ready to scale beyond word-of-mouth

The businesses that win aren't the ones with perfect websites. They're the ones that launched fast, started getting traffic, and adjusted based on real customer behavior.
