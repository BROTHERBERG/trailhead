Most web design agencies quote 2-6 months for a simple website. We launch custom-coded sites in one week (6 business days). No templates. No corners cut.

Here's exactly how we do it.

## Why Most Websites Take Months

The typical agency timeline looks like this:

- **Week 1-2:** Discovery calls, endless questionnaires
- **Week 3-6:** Design revisions (the client wants "more modern")
- **Week 7-10:** Development starts (finally)
- **Week 11-14:** Client feedback loop hell
- **Week 15-20:** "Just a few more changes"
- **Week 21-24:** Launch... maybe

The problem isn't the work. It's the waste:
- Scope creep (every meeting adds "just one more feature")
- Committee approvals (7 stakeholders, 7 different opinions)
- Revision paralysis (endless tweaks, never shipped)
- No urgency (the longer it takes, the more they can bill)

We eliminate all of that.

## Our 6-Day Process

### Day 1: Discovery & Content

**Morning:** 60-minute kickoff call. We learn:
- What your business does
- Who you're trying to reach
- What action you want visitors to take
- Your brand vibe (professional? friendly? bold?)

**Afternoon:** You deliver everything we need:
- Text content for each section
- Logo and brand colors
- Images/photos
- Any "must-haves" (specific features, integrations)

**Why this works:** We ask focused questions. You provide focused answers. No 47-page creative brief. No endless discovery workshops.

**Deliverable:** Sitemap approved, design direction confirmed.

### Day 2-3: Design & Development

We don't do separate "design phase" and "dev phase." We design *in code*.

**What we're building:**
- Custom Next.js site (hand-coded, zero templates)
- Your content, laid out for conversions
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Forms connected and working
- Analytics tracking configured
- Baseline SEO setup (meta tags, structured data, sitemap)

**Why this is fast:**
- No "mockup approval" bottleneck
- Design and code happen simultaneously
- We use proven conversion patterns (tested across 100+ sites)
- Fixed scope = no feature creep

**Deliverable:** Working prototype with your actual content.

---

### Day 4: Review & Revision

You get a live preview link. You review the site. You tell us what to change.

**The rules:**
- Two revision rounds total (this is round one)
- Changes must be within the original scope
- We're optimizing what's there, not adding new sections

**Why this works:**
- Most client feedback is the same: "make this bigger," "change that color," "move this section up"
- We know what real users respond to, so we push back on changes that hurt conversions
- Fixed revisions = no endless tweaking

**Deliverable:** Your feedback incorporated, site 95% done.

---

### Day 5: Polish & Testing

We're not launching a broken site. Day 5 is all QA:

- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Mobile device testing (iPhone, Android, tablet)
- Form submissions working (we test them, you get the email)
- Page speed optimization (target: Lighthouse 90+)
- Accessibility checks (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- SSL certificate configured
- Final content proofread

**Why agencies skip this:**
- They're behind schedule (always)
- QA takes time and doesn't make money
- "We'll fix bugs after launch" (they won't)

**Deliverable:** Production-ready website, zero known bugs.

---

### Day 6: Launch

Your site goes live. For real.

- Domain connected (or we set up a subdomain)
- SSL active (green padlock in browser)
- Forms tested and working
- Analytics tracking live
- Google Search Console configured
- You get login credentials and a walkthrough

**Day 7:** You're capturing leads.

## What Makes This Possible

**1. Fixed Scope**
One-page website. That's it. No "let's add a blog" on Day 3. Constraints = speed.

**2. Owner-Operators Only**
Our clients can make decisions. No waiting for committee approval. "I like it" means we move forward.

**3. Two Revisions, Not Twenty**
Endless revisions kill timelines. Two rounds forces you to think critically about what actually matters.

**4. We've Done This 100+ Times**
Every landscaping site needs the same sections (services, service area, contact). Every consultant needs the same layout (problem, solution, credibility, CTA). We know what works.

**5. No Upsells Mid-Project**
We're not trying to sell you a $5,000 "premium package" on Day 3. The price is $750. That's it.

## What You're NOT Getting

Let's be honest about what one week can't deliver:

- **Not a 10-page site.** One page only. If you need a full blog, e-commerce, or member portal, you need more time (and budget).
- **Not endless revisions.** Two rounds. After that, we charge $10 per edit.
- **Not a custom CMS.** You get a fast, static site. Content updates go through us (included in the $18/mo plan).
- **Not corporate committee-friendly.** If 7 people need to approve every color, this won't work.

## Real Timeline: Landscaping Client

Here's an actual project from last month:

- **Monday 9am:** Kickoff call with Ryan (landscaping company owner)
- **Monday 3pm:** Ryan sends content, logo, 6 photos
- **Tuesday-Wednesday:** We build the site
- **Thursday 10am:** Ryan reviews, sends feedback ("move testimonials higher, change CTA button color")
- **Thursday 4pm:** Revisions done, Ryan approves
- **Friday:** Final QA, speed optimization
- **Saturday 2pm:** Site goes live
- **Sunday 11am:** Ryan's first lead form submission

**Total:** 6 days, start to finish.

## Why This Works for Small Businesses

If you're a solopreneur, contractor, or local service business, you don't need:
- A 3-month timeline
- A $10,000 budget
- Weekly status meetings
- A 50-page website

You need:
- A professional site that doesn't look like a template
- Fast loading (Google cares, your visitors care)
- A contact form that works
- Mobile optimization (60% of traffic is mobile)
- To launch *this week*, not this quarter

That's what we deliver.

## The One-Week Guarantee

If your content is ready on Day 1, we launch on Day 6. Period.

We've never missed a deadline. Not once. Because:
- Fixed scope = no surprises
- Proven process = no guesswork
- No dependencies = no delays

Most agencies can't promise this because they're juggling 20 clients and selling whatever "premium features" they can upsell.

We launch one-page sites in one week. That's the entire business model.

## Ready to Launch?

If you have:
- Your content ready (text, images, branding)
- Decision-making authority (no committee approvals)
- A clear goal (get leads, book calls, sell a service)
- $750 for the build + $18/mo for hosting

We can have your site live in 6 days.

**Common Questions:**

**Q: What if I don't have content ready?**
A: We can't start. The one-week timeline requires Day 1 content delivery. We can help with a content template, but you need to write it (or hire a copywriter).

**Q: Can you add a blog after launch?**
A: Yes, but it's a separate project. The one-week build is one page only.

**Q: What if I want changes after launch?**
A: The $18/mo Care & Hosting includes 2 content updates per month (30 min each). Bigger changes are $10 per edit.

**Q: Is one page enough?**
A: For most local businesses, yes. One strong page converts better than 5 mediocre pages. You can always expand later.
