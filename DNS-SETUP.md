## ‚è±Ô∏è DNS Propagation

- **Time**: 5-60 minutes (usually ~15 minutes)
- **What happens**: DNS changes spread globally
- **Check progress**: Use https://dnschecker.org

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Check DNS Propagation
Visit https://dnschecker.org and enter:
- `trailhead.agency` - Should show `76.76.21.21`
- `www.trailhead.agency` - Should show `cname.vercel-dns.com`

### Test Your Site
Once DNS propagates, visit:
- https://trailhead.agency
- https://www.trailhead.agency

Both should load your site with SSL (secure connection).

### Verify Contact Form
1. Go to https://trailhead.agency
2. Scroll to "Start Your Project" form
3. Fill it out and submit
4. Check https://formspree.io/forms/movkypvy/submissions

## üîê SSL Certificate

Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates. You'll see:
- ‚úÖ Automatic HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Free SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ Auto-renewal
- ‚úÖ Both root and www domains secured

**Status**: Vercel is creating SSL certificates now (this happens automatically after DNS is configured)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "This site can't be reached"
- **Cause**: DNS not propagated yet
- **Fix**: Wait 15-30 minutes, clear browser cache

### "Not Secure" Warning
- **Cause**: SSL certificate still provisioning
- **Fix**: Wait 5-10 minutes after DNS propagates

### Site loads but form doesn't work
- **Cause**: Environment variables not set
- **Fix**: Already configured! Should work fine.

### Squarespace blocking changes
- **Cause**: Domain might be locked or have auto-renewal
- **Fix**: Contact Squarespace support or check domain settings
